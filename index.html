                            My name is Gordon Kamer, and I'm in Harvard College's class of 2023.
                            In addition to coursework in the social sciences, I have done extensive work in computer science and mathematics.
                            I made this website to present a snapshot of the coding projects I've worked on outside of school. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Best, <br/>

                    <div class=project-description>
                        My senior year of college, I made, as a part of my thesis, a way to specify neural network architectures in a declarative manner.
                        I thought that this approach could make neural networks easier to visualize, understand, create, and inspect.
                        You can read more about it in my thesis, <a class="extLink" href="Thesis.pdf">here</a>.

I helped perform statistical analysis and to draft the manuscript. While the study was done in Stata, I recreated it to an extent in R in order to validate the results as we were working. This repo contains the version of the study done in R. The study found that there was statistically significant evidence that the opening of stores following legalization of recreational marijuana was associated with an increase in the traffic fatality rate.

                        During summer of 2020, a friend of mine and I made a simulation in Python that calculates the value of a baseball team in discounted championships. 
                        The value represents the sum of championship win probability for every year into the future, discounted using an interest rate given by the user.
                        The simulation predicts the Wins Above Replacement for every player on every team an arbitrary number of years into the future.
                        A team's players' combined WAR determines its championship probability, according to historical figures.
                        It accounts for draft picks, MLB free agency, and amateur free agency.
                        Using multiprocessing, Cython, and Numpy optimizations, we reduced the time it takes to run a simulation by thirty times compared to our first implementation.

                        A friend of mine spent a lot of time playing the game Merged, which is a mobile game with similarities to
                        2048. We were both in an artificial intelligence course and thought that it would be fun to see if we could
                        get an AI to play the game. We followed the template of Google's AlphaZero and used a deep neural network to
                        value different moves in the game (implemented using PyTorch). Training data for the neural network was generated by Monte Carlo tree search.
                        I spent a lot of time fiddling with hyperparameters and learning about each model design choice I was making.
                        In the end the AI developed a strategy that was much better than what I was doing and played significantly better than random.
                        So the deep learning approach was successful.

                        In order to get better at both chess and C++, I wrote a chess engine.
                        The program asks you whether you would prefer to play as black, white, or a random color.
                        You input moves in algebraic chess notation, and the computer responds in the same notation. The computer knows when to disambiguate moves.
                        The computer can successfully identify illegal moves and only plays legal moves. The computer will play a legal move at random.
                        In order to see a print out of the board, enter "show" instead of your move.

                        At a summer camp I worked at, kids and counselors played a game like Rock, Paper, Scissors but with far more interesting strategic elements.
                        First off, the game was repeated, and previous moves influenced available moves in the future.
                        At camp, we talked a lot about optimal strategy, and I thought it would be a good project to find the game's mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.
                        In the GitHub repository is the Python code I wrote to solve the game and a write-up in Latex explaining the game, the solution, and how to find it.
                        I also wrote a program that simulates the CPU's strategy so that you can play against it. I also included code to test the CPU against other strategies.

                        Enemy Inbound is a game in Java that I made for the Ludum Dare game jam in 2013 when I was in 7th grade.
                        Over the years, I lost the original source code, but I still had the .jar file. I ran it through a decompiler and put the result on Github.
                        It's a dual stick shooter with a minimalist art style (to be honest, the only art style I could do in 2013). You face an increasing number of enemies and can upgrade weapons and buy health.

                        Before taking a course where I was going to use C, I figured that I would do a short refresher project working with something at the bit level.
                        Inspired by <a style="color:black;font-size:inherit;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWEXCYQKyDc&t=290s">this</a> Computerphile video, I made a command line application that can encode and read hidden messages in images.
                        It works by hiding the messages in the two least significant bits of each byte in the image file.
