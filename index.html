                            Hello, <br/>
                            <br/>
                            My name is Gordon Kamer, and I'm in Harvard College's class of 2022.
                            I like computers, and I've programmed them since around 5th grade.
                            I made this website to show off some of my work. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Best, <br/>
                            Gordon <br/>

                        Enemy Inbound is a game in Java that I made for the Ludum Dare game jam in 2013.
                        Over the years, I lost the original source code, but I still had the .jar file. I ran it through a decompiler and put the result on github.
                        It's a dual stick shooter with a minimalist art style (to be honest, the only art style I could do in 2013). You face an increasing number of enemies and can upgrade weapons and buy health.

                        Before taking a course where I was going to use C, I figured that I would get some experience managing memory and doing other C-like things in C.
                        Inspired by <a style="color:black;font-size:inherit;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWEXCYQKyDc&t=290s">this</a> Computerphile video, I made a command line application that can encode and read hidden messages in images.
                        It works by hiding the messages in the two least significant bits of each byte in the image file.

                        In June 2020, a <a style="color: black; font-size: inherit" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2767643?guestAccessKey=55702ba9-61c9-42de-8639-11dfa70b0fa6&utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_content=tfl&utm_term=062220">study</a> on which I was co-authored was published in JAMA Internal Medicine. I helped perform statistical analysis and to draft the manuscript. While the study was done in Stata, I recreated it to an extent in R in order to validate the results as we were working. This repo contains the version of the study done in R. The study found that there was statistically significant evidence that the opening of stores following legalization of recreational marijuana was associated with an increase in the traffic fatality rate.
